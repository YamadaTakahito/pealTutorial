Summary: in this tutorial we will give you a brief introduction to Perl programming language including language features, versions, and the inventor.

introduction to PerlPowerful, stable, portable and mature, Perl is one of the most feature-rich programming languages with over two decades of development. Perl is portable and cross-platform. At the time of this writing, Perl can run on over 100 platforms. Perl is good for mission-critical large-scale projects as well as rapid prototyping.

Perl features
Perl is used for mission critical projects because its code is high quality. According to the Coverity analysis, Perl’s core code has been certified free of security flaws and has low defect density.

Perl is extendable. Perl has more than hundreds of thousands open sources modules on Comprehensive Perl Archive Network (CPAN). Those modules provide many powerful extensions to the standard library e.g., XML processing, graphical user interfaces and database integration that supports major database management systems including Oracle, Sybase, PostgresSQL, MySQL and many more.

Perl is an easy-to-use language. It is intended to be efficient and complete rather than elegant and minimal. Perl supports some major programming paradigms including object-oriented, procedural, and functional.

One of the most remarkable features of Perl is text manipulation. Perl comes with a set powerful APIs for processing text that makes it perfect for working with XML, HTML, and other markup languages. A key feature of text manipulation in Perl is regular expression engine. This is the reason why Perl is popular for both command-line tools and web applications.

Perl is an open source project developing and evolving by an active community of programmers and professionals who really use it. You can use or distribute Perl freely under the term of Artistic License or GNU, GPL Licenses. Perl’s commercial support services are also available.
